# MAPD_B-Project
Group Project for the Management and Analysis of Physics Datasets mod.B course.

The Project consisted of parallel analysis of moderately-sized datasets (>5Gb) regarding alarms/sensors for thermal machines.

In order to achieve this, parallel processing libraries were employed using a cluster of three distinct machines on the university network.
These were remotely accessed and managed by the group.

Made using Dask Python Library.

Project was submitted and evaluated in late-September 2023.
